            <p>
               I made this as my inspiration station because of a few reasons. First, I thought that the colours red and black would make a good combination because they are both very striking colours and contrast well together. I chose red more specifically because it's proven to cause strong emotions in the viewer. Second, I thought that the quote was very impactful. It gives a sense of responsibility in the viewer and it's from someone in media that I look up too. Lastly, I thought that the group of people gave it a sense of community and togetherness that it wouldn't if it was just one person.
